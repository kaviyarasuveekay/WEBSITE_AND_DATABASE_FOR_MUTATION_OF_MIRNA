# WEBSITE_AND_DATABASE_FOR_MUTATION_OF_MIRNA
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules typically containing ~22 nucleotides found in human, animals, plants and some viruses which are playing an important regulatory role in the gene translation via silencing or degradation of target mRNAs. They are involved in many important biological processes and the dysfunction of microRNA has been associated with many diseases. MicroRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerases II and III, generating precursors that undergo a series of cleavage events to form mature microRNA. The main aim of the project is to create a database and a website regarding the necessary information of mutations that occur in miRNA.
